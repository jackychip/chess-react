# chess-react

(not using chess.js) <-- why make it easy for yourself?

it's gonna be a pain in the ass learning how to frontend java, so i'm just gonna use react and typescript.

some new features may include:
- multiplayer with socket.io
- ui/ux stuff
- matchmaking maybe

enjoy nitpicking my code!!!
